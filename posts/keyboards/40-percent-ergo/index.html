<h1 class="title">Questioning the ergonomics of 40% keyboards</h1>
<h2 class="author">Pascal Getreuer, 2022-04-26</h2>

<p>Small 40% keyboards with 45 keys or under have a lot of attention
around the custom keyboard community. Noting low finger travel, it’s
commonly suggested that 40% keyboards are ergonomically beneficial. This
is questionable advice for people looking to improve their typing
comfort. While smaller keyboards do reduce finger travel, they make
other things worse. On the whole, 40% keyboards are not a clear win.</p>
<p>To be clear, I’m not saying 40% keyboards aren’t practical. People
can and do use them practically. If you use a 40% or below and enjoy
doing it, don’t let me stop you.</p>
<p>However, if your interest in custom keyboards is <em>ergonomics</em>,
as it is for me, then 40% keyboards are a questionable direction.</p>
<p>The ergonomics argument for 40% keyboards is that “all keys are at
most 1u away from home row position, so finger travel is lower than it
would be on larger keyboards.” This is good. The compromise made though,
with so few keys, is that extensive use of layers, combos, or other
tricks is unavoidable to represent frequently used keys. That means a
lot more key presses and stress on the hands (to change the layer, to
make the combo, …) to accomplish the same typing.</p>
<p><strong>More key presses = more work, counteracting the benefit of
lower finger travel.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Combos</strong> are more work than regular keys. For
instance, combo’ing on 3 keys needs 3x actuation force compared to a
single key. Combos are sometimes advocated noting that this resembles
how stenographers make strokes on only 22 keys. But to make this
ergonomic, stenotype machines use switches with under 10 g actuation
force, well below the typical 40–60 g actuation force on
keyboards.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Layers</strong> make it possible to put more keys on or
near home row, which is good. But there is a tradeoff that switching
layers in itself costs pressing and holding a key (or tapping a key,
depending on the type of layer key), and on its own, pressing a layer
switch accomplishes no typing. Layers become inefficient when switching
is frequently needed. While a well-designed keymap mitigates switching
by placing co-occurring keys on the same layer, a 40% keyboard has
limited space per layer, and frequent layer switching is
inevitable.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The base layer gets much better even with just a handful more
keys.</strong> For instance 56 keys is enough to fit a traditional
layout alphas area (30 keys), number row (10 keys), and outer columns (8
keys) on the base layer plus a few more keys (8 keys) on the thumbs or
bottom row. This isn’t necessarily optimal, but likely closer to the
sweet spot between low finger travel vs. avoiding layers and combos for
frequent keys.</p>
