<p><strong>Here’s a handy glossary</strong> of the obtuse internet
slang, technical jargon, and anatomical terms that come up in
discussions about keyboards. Most entries include links to resources
with further description. For more depth or anything keyboard-related
not covered here, <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/">r/ErgoMechKeyboards</a>
is a good place to ask.</p>
<h3 id="x">40% / 60% / X%</h3>
<p><strong>40%, 60%, or other “X%”</strong> denote the approximate
number of keys on a keyboard, relative to 100% being a standard keyboard
(104 keys in the US, 105 outside the US).</p>
<figure>

<h3 id="alpha-layout">Alpha layout</h3>
<p><em>Detailed description: <a href="../alt-layouts/index.html">A guide
to alt keyboard layouts (why, how, which one?)</a></em></p>
<p>An <strong>alpha layout</strong> is an arrangement of the alphabet
keys on the keyboard. The alpha layout is <strong>QWERTY</strong> on a
standard US keyboard. <strong>Dvorak</strong> and
<strong>Colemak</strong> are two examples of alternative layouts. There
are many others, see the references below.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../alt-layouts/colemak-dh-layout.svg"
alt="Colemak-DH, a popular alternative alpha layout." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><a
href="https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/">Colemak-DH</a>, a popular
alternative alpha layout.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Most modern alternative layouts focus on improved typing comfort and
efficiency, with keys arranged such that awkward motions are avoided.
This is usually evaluated in terms of metrics that quantify the
frequencies of specific undesired finger motions, such as <a
href="#same-finger-bigram-sfb">same-finger bigrams</a> and <a
href="#roll">rolls</a>, measured over a given text corpus.</p>

<h3 id="callum-style-mods">Callum-style mods</h3>
<p><strong>Callum-style mods</strong> are a method for <a
href="#modifiers">modifier keys</a> (Ctrl, Shift, Alt, GUI) on a small
keyboard, named after Callum Oakley who <a
href="https://github.com/callum-oakley/qmk_firmware/tree/master/users/callum">described
them in his keymap</a>. A similar scheme is also used in <a
href="https://stevep99.github.io/seniply/">SteveP’s Seniply
keymap</a>.</p>
<p>Mods are engaged as one-shot (sticky) keys on the home row of a
secondary layer. This layer is accessed by a momentary layer switch from
the base layer. As Callum says, “You can and should hit chords as fast
as you like because there are no timers involved.” In contrast to <a
href="#home-row-mods-hrms">home row mods</a>, Callum-style mods entirely
avoid <a href="#mod-tap-key">mod-tap keys</a>.</p>
<h3 id="caps-word">Caps Word</h3>
<p><strong>Caps Word</strong> is a modernized Caps Lock that
automatically disables at the end of the word, useful for typing
abbreviations and ALL_CAPS identifiers.</p>

<h3 id="carpal-tunnel">Carpal tunnel</h3>
<p>The <strong>carpal tunnel</strong> is a narrow passageway on the palm
side of the wrist formed by the arch-shaped <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_bones">carpal bones</a> and
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexor_retinaculum_of_the_hand">flexor
retinaculum</a> connective tissue. The flexor tendons to the fingers and
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_nerve">median
nerve</a> pass through the carpal tunnel.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../thumb-ergo/carpal-tunnel.svg"
alt="Median nerve passing through the carpal tunnel." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Median nerve passing through the carpal
tunnel.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome">Carpal
tunnel syndrome (CTS)</a>, also more specifically referred to as
Idiopathic Median Neuropathy at the Carpal Tunnel (IMNCT), is a
condition where the median nerve is pinched in the carpal tunnel,
perhaps because inflammation caused surrounding tissues to swell and
decrease the space in the tunnel.</p>
<h3 id="debouncing">Debouncing</h3>
<p><strong>Debouncing</strong> is a method to ignore “bounces” in raw
key press signals. Electrical contacts in a <a href="#key-switch">key
switch</a> are usually springy material. When the switch is pressed, the
contacts bounce, causing a phenomenon called contact bounce or chatter
where the raw digital reading bounces between 0 and 1 before settling to
a steady contact.</p>
<p><img src="../faqs/bounce.svg" /></p>

</ul>
<h3 id="eeprom">EEPROM</h3>
<p><strong>EEPROM</strong> or <strong>electrically erasable programmable
read-only memory</strong> is a small amount of rewritable memory that
persists even without power (non-volatile memory). Some keyboards save
certain settings in EEPROM, such <a
href="https://docs.qmk.fm/keycodes_magic">magic settings</a> on
QMK-based keyboards. These settings are retained when the keyboard is
unpowered and even when new <a href="#firmware">firmware</a> is
flashed.</p>
<h3 id="firmware">Firmware</h3>
<p>A keyboard’s <strong>firmware</strong> is software that runs on the
<a href="#microcontroller-unit-mcu">microcontroller</a>. This software
scans the <a href="#matrix-circuit">matrix circuit</a>, <a
href="#debouncing">debounces</a> the raw signals, and sends <a
href="#keyboard-report">reports</a> of key events to the host computer.
On a standard keyboard, firmware is stored in read-only memory.</p>
<p>On a programmable keyboard, firmware is stored in flash memory and
can be rewritten to update it. Additionally, the microcontroller
processes features such as layers, <a href="#macro-key">macros</a>, and
<a href="#mod-tap-key">mod-taps</a>. Well-known firmware for
programmable keyboards include <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm">QMK
firmware</a> and <a href="https://zmk.dev">ZMK firmware</a>.</p>
<h3 id="home-row-mods-hrms">Home row mods (HRMs)</h3>
<p><strong>Home row mods or HRMs</strong> is a scheme of using <a
href="#mod-tap-key">mod-taps</a> on the home row, as popularized by
precondition’s <a href="https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods">A
guide to home row mods</a> and the <a
href="https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku">Miryoku keymap</a>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="home-row-mods.svg" alt="An example of home row mods." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">An example of home row mods.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>HRMs have the benefits that “modifier+key” chords are easier to press
and that no dedicated keys are needed for the modifiers.</p>
<p>HRMs are challenging in that they are prone to accidental mod
triggers in fast typing. <a href="#callum-style-mods">Callum-style
mods</a> are a popular alternative. HRMs can be made effective with good
configuration and practice, as discussed in <a
href="../faqs/index.html#home-row-mods-are-hard-to-use">Home row mods
are hard to use</a>.</p>
<h3 id="homing-keycaps">Homing keycaps</h3>
<p><strong>Homing keycaps</strong> are <a href="#keycap">keycaps</a>
with a distinctive tactile ridge or dish, conventionally on the
<kbd>F</kbd> and <kbd>J</kbd> keys (home row index finger positions in
QWERTY layout). This feature allows typists to locate home position
without needing to look at the keyboard.</p>
<h3 id="hot-swappable-switches">Hot-swappable switches</h3>
<p>The <a href="#printed-circuit-board-pcb">printed circuit board</a> or
PCB of a mechanical keyboard may support <strong>hotswapping</strong>
the <a href="#key-switch">key switches</a>, meaning the switches can be
easily changed using a key puller tool. The switch snaps into a
<strong>swappable keysocket</strong> without using solder. In contrast,
switches in a non-swappable mechanical keyboard are soldered to the
PCB.</p>
<h3 id="key-rollover-6kro-nkro">Key rollover (6KRO, NKRO)</h3>
<p><strong>Key rollover</strong> is the max number of simultaneously key
presses that can be correctly <a href="#keyboard-report">reported</a>.
<strong>6KRO</strong> (6-key rollover) means reporting up to six keys at
once. <strong>NKRO</strong> (N-key rollover) means any number of keys
may be pressed at once.</p>
<h3 id="key-switch">Key switch</h3>
<p>A <strong>key switch</strong> in a mechanical keyboard registers when
it is pressed and represents this as an electrical signal. Switches are
electrically connected to the <a href="#matrix-circuit">matrix
circuit</a>. The choice of switch affects the feel and sound of the
keyboard.</p>
<figure>
<img src="key-switch.gif" alt="A key switch in action." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A key switch in action.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Some key switch terminology:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pre-travel</strong> is the depth or distance of travel
before reaching the <strong>actuation point</strong> where the switch
<strong>actuates</strong> and registers the press.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Total travel</strong> is the full distance of travel
before <strong>bottoming out</strong> the switch.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Actuation force</strong> is the minimum force needed to
actuate the switch. This force is conventionally reported in units of gf
(gram-force) or cN (centinewtons), being close to equal at 1 gf ≈
0.98 cN. Actuation force of around 45 gf is typical.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="#keycap">keycap</a> mounts on the
<strong>stem</strong> on the top of the switch. There are several types
of stems, including <strong>MX-style stems</strong> with a cross shape,
<strong>box stems</strong> in some Kailh switches, and <strong>Choc
stems</strong> having two prongs. Keycaps must be compatible to
mate.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Left: Cherry MX Brown switch. Right:
Ambients Silent Nocturnal Choc V1 switch.</figcaption>
</figure></li>
</ul>
<p>Key switches are often named by color, referring to how Cherry
originally used stem colors to distinguish different switches:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reds or linears</strong> press smoothly for the full travel
without added effects.</li>
<li><strong>Browns or tactiles</strong> have a “tactile bump” felt just
before the actuation point.</li>
<li><strong>Blues or clickies</strong> are switches producing a click
sound at the actuation point.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="key-wells">Key wells</h3>
<p><strong>Key wells</strong> are an ergonomic feature on some keyboards
where off-home rows curl toward the fingers, and the depths of the
columns are designed to fit the length of the finger, forming concave
“wells.” Dactyl is a family of open source keyboards featuring key
wells.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../dactyl-ergodox.jpg"
alt="A keyboard with concave key wells (Dactyl Ergodox)." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A keyboard with concave key wells (Dactyl
Ergodox).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The idea is that keys off the home row can be reached with less
finger movement than would be needed on a flat keyboard.</p>
<p>Key wells may also describe a cluster of keys around every finger, as
in the DataHand and Svalboard keyboards. This design enables typing with
extremely low finger movement.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../svalboard.jpg"
alt="A keyboard where each finger has a key well (Svalboard Lightly)." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A keyboard where each finger has a key
well (Svalboard Lightly).</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="keyboard-report">Keyboard report</h3>
<p>The <a href="#microcontroller-unit-mcu">microcontroller</a> sends
<strong>keyboard reports</strong> to the host computer to indicate key
presses and changes in <a href="#modifiers">modifier</a> state. The
report contains an array of keycodes that are currently held as defined
in <a
href="https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/documents/hut1_12v2.pdf">HID
Keyboard/Keypad Usage Page (0x07) spec</a>. The mods state is
represented as an 8-bit bitfield:</p>
<p><img src="8-bit-mods.svg" /></p>
<p>Typically, the report has capacity to represent up to 6 held keys at
once, implementing <a href="#key-rollover-6kro-nkro">6-key
rollover</a>:</p>
<p><img src="keyboard-report-6kro.svg" /></p>
<p>For <a href="#key-rollover-6kro-nkro">N-key rollover</a>, the report
is extended with a 120-bit bitfield to represent the state of all 120
supported keys:</p>
<p><img src="keyboard-report-nkro.svg" /></p>
<h3 id="keycap">Keycap</h3>
<p>The <strong>keycap</strong> is the flesh-facing part of the key that
is pressed with the finger. On mechanical keyboards, it mounts on the
<strong>stem</strong> of the <a href="#key-switch">key switch</a>.</p>
<p>Some keycap terminology:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Keycap profile</strong> is the shape of the top surface
of the keycap. Common profiles include Cherry profile, SA (Spherical
All), DSA (Deep Sculpted Angled), and MT3 (Matt3o). The profile often
differs for different rows of the keyboard.</p></li>
<li><p>Keycaps often have a <strong>legend</strong> to label what
function the key has. <strong>Printed legends</strong> are cheap but
fade with wear. <strong>Double shot</strong> and <strong>dye
sublimation</strong> are more expensive manufacturing methods with
better durability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stabilizers</strong> or <strong>stabs</strong> are
components used with larger keycaps to prevent wobble and rattle and
ensure even key travel.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Artisans</strong> are decorative, handmade keycaps,
treated like a piece of art.</p></li>
<li><p>Most keycaps are made of <strong>ABS</strong> (acrylonitrile
butadiene styrene), <strong>PBT</strong> (polybutylene terephthalate),
or less commonly <strong>POM</strong> (polyoxymethylene) plastics.

<h3 id="lateral-stretch-bigram-lsb">Lateral stretch bigram (LSB)</h3>
<p>A <strong>lateral stretch bigram</strong> or <strong>LSB</strong> is
a two-key sequence typed by adjacent fingers where a lateral stretch
(abduction) is involved to reach the keys. How frequently LSBs occur is
often considered in <a href="#alpha-layout">layout design</a>. LSBs are
generally considered undesirable.</p>
<p>What exactly constitutes a “lateral stretch” is complicated,
influenced by hand size, wrist angle, and whether the keys are <a
href="#row-staggered-ortholinear-column-staggered">row staggered</a> or
something else.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> Typing <code>ET</code> on QWERTY is an LSB with the
left middle and index fingers. The fingers stretch laterally apart to
span the 2u distance between keys <kbd>E</kbd> and <kbd>T</kbd>.</p>
<h3 id="macro-key">Macro key</h3>
<p>A <strong>macro key</strong> is a key that, when pressed, sends a
predefined sequence of keys such as typing your email address. Or used
more broadly, a macro describes a key having some customized
function.</p>

<p><a href="#split-keyboard">True split keyboards</a> have two MCUs, one
for each side, often connected by a <a href="#trrs-cable">TRRS
cable</a>.</p>
<p>Keyboards often use cheap AVR microcontrollers, like the Pro Micro
and Elite-C boards with the ATmega32U4 microcontroller. While they are
enough to get running, AVR microcontrollers have a stingy amount of
flash space, and you’ll need to be sparing in which firmware features to
enable in order to fit in that space (see <a
href="https://docs.qmk.fm/squeezing_avr">Squeezing the most out of
AVR</a>). If you have an option to use a better microcontroller, I’d
recommend it.</p>
<h3 id="modifiers">Modifiers</h3>
<p>There are eight <strong>modifiers</strong> or <strong>mods</strong>
for short: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>Shift</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd>, and
<kbd>GUI</kbd>, all both on the left and right sides (as defined in the
<a
href="https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/documents/hut1_12v2.pdf">HID
spec</a>). The “GUI” mod, aka Super, corresponds to the Windows key on
Windows machines and Command ⌘ on Mac.</p>
<p>Outside the US, the right Alt modifier is commonly used as the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltGr_key">AltGr key</a>
(abbreviating “alternate graphic”) to type additional symbols.</p>
<h3 id="mod-tap-key">Mod-tap key</h3>
<p>A <strong>mod-tap key</strong> is a tap-hold or dual-role key that
behaves as a <a href="#modifiers">modifier</a> (Ctrl, Shift, Alt, or
GUI) when held and as some other key when tapped. A common mod-tap use
is a key that behaves as Ctrl when held and Escape when tapped.</p>

<h3 id="mouse-keys">Mouse keys</h3>
<p><strong>Mouse keys</strong> uses keyboard keys to emulate a mouse.
This includes keys for cursor movement, the mouse wheel, and the mouse
buttons.</p>
<p>Most keyboard keys are limited to digital on/off inputs. This makes
it difficult to support both large, fast movements and small, precise
movements. Mouse keys often speed up the longer they’re held down to
address this limitation. Another approach is to use dedicated keys to
change the movement speed.</p>

<h3 id="pinky-stagger">Pinky stagger</h3>
<p>On a keyboard with <a
href="#row-staggered-ortholinear-column-staggered">column staggered
layout</a>, <strong>pinky stagger</strong> refers to the offset of pinky
columns. These columns are adjusted closer to the body to account for
the shorter length of the pinky fingers. An “aggressive pinky stagger”
describes a large offset.</p>

<h3 id="polling-rate">Polling rate</h3>
<p><strong>Polling rate</strong> refers to how frequently the keyboard
sends <a href="#keyboard-report">keyboard reports</a> to the host
computer. A higher rate reduces <strong>input lag</strong> and improves
responsiveness. A typical keyboard has a polling rate of at least
125 Hz, or once every 8 milliseconds. This is so fast that polling delay
is visually imperceptible, less than one frame of 60 fps video
(16.7 ms).</p>
<p>See also: <a
href="../faqs/index.html#how-much-lag-do-custom-keyboards-have">How much
lag do custom keyboards have?</a></p>
<h3 id="printed-circuit-board-pcb">Printed circuit board (PCB)</h3>
<p>A <strong>printed circuit board</strong> or <strong>PCB</strong> is
sandwiched layers of conductive and insulating material. Conductive
traces and pads are etched to create an electrical circuit. In a
keyboard, the PCB implements the <a href="#matrix-circuit">matrix
circuit</a> and a footprint to seat the <a
href="#microcontroller-unit-mcu">microcontroller</a>. Not all keyboards
use a PCB. Some keyboards are <strong>hand wired</strong> instead.</p>
<h3 id="pronation-supination">Pronation / supination</h3>
<p><strong>Pronation</strong> and <strong>supination</strong> are medial
rotations of the radius about the ulna, as in the motions of turning a
screwdriver or key. <strong>Pronation</strong> turns the palm facing
downward. <strong>Supination</strong> is the opposite direction turning
the palm upward.</p>
<figure>
<img src="pronation-supination.svg"
alt="Left: Pronation. Right: Supination." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Left: Pronation. Right:
Supination.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When using a standard flat keyboard, the forearms
<strong>pronate</strong> fully to turn the palms down. Sustained
pronation increases pressure on the tissues and reduces blood
circulation. This can lead to fatigue and injury. Many ergonomic
keyboards are <a href="#tenting">tented</a> to reduce pronation.</p>
<h3 id="redirect">Redirect</h3>
<p>A <strong>redirect</strong> or <strong>roll reversal</strong> is a
sequence of three keys typed by one hand that changes <a
href="#roll">roll direction</a> from inward to outward or vice versa.
How frequently redirects occur is often considered in <a
href="#alpha-layout">layout design</a>. Redirects are generally
undesirable, as they tend to be more difficult to type quickly compared
to sequences that alternate hands or maintain the same roll
direction.</p>
<p>Redirects might be more tolerable when they involve an index finger,
since they are especially dexterous. Redirects that do or don’t include
index fingers are sometimes distinguished, e.g. “weak redirects,” though
terminology varies.</p>
<p><em>Examples, on QWERTY:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>SAD</code> is a redirect: <kbd>S</kbd> → <kbd>A</kbd> rolls
outward, and <kbd>A</kbd> → <kbd>D</kbd> rolls inward.</li>
<li><code>ARE</code> is a weak redirect, with <kbd>R</kbd> is typed by
left index finger.</li>
<li><code>NOW</code> is <em>not</em> a redirect, since it is not a
one-handed typing sequence.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="roll">Roll</h3>
<p>A <strong>roll</strong> is a sequence of two or more keystrokes made
by one hand, where the fingers move sequentially across the keyboard,
like drumming your fingers.</p>
<figure>
<video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
<source src="finger-drumming.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
</figure>
<p>According to the direction, a roll is either an <strong>inward
roll</strong>, moving pinky → ring → middle → index, or an
<strong>outward roll</strong>, moving in the opposite direction. On
QWERTY, <code>ER</code>, <code>LY</code>, and <code>AWE</code> are
examples of inward rolls, and <code>EA</code> and <code>IO</code> are
outward rolls.</p>
<figure>
<img src="roll.gif" alt="ER is an inward roll on QWERTY." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><code>ER</code> is an inward roll on
QWERTY.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Inward rolls are generally considered desirable. Modern <a
href="#alpha-layout">alpha layouts</a> are often designed to maximize
rolls. A <strong>rolly layout</strong> is a layout where rolls are
frequent.</p>
<p>Subjective preferences vary on whether outward rolls are also
favored. Accordingly, layouts sometimes maximize the <strong>in-roll
ratio</strong>, the frequency of inward rolls divided by the frequency
of outward rolls.</p>
<h3 id="row-staggered-ortholinear-column-staggered">Row staggered /
ortholinear / column staggered</h3>
<p>Standard keyboards have <strong>row staggered</strong> keys, with a
small horizontal offset from one row to the next. This is a vestige of
mechanical typewriters to make space for levers that connect each key to
the type hammers that strike the paper.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>An <strong>ortholinear</strong> or <strong>matrix</strong>
arrangement removes the stagger and places all keys in a regular grid.
This helps reduce ulnar deviation in the left wrist.</p>
<p><strong>Column staggered</strong> or <strong>columnar</strong>
arrangement staggers in the other dimension, following the natural
direction of the fingers. This further helps reduce <a
href="#ulnar-deviation-radial-deviation">ulnar deviation</a> and makes
off-home rows easier to reach.</p>

<h3 id="same-finger-bigram-sfb">Same-finger bigram (SFB)</h3>
<p>A <strong>same-finger bigram</strong> or <strong>SFB</strong> is a
two-key sequence in which both keys are typed by the same finger, such
as <code>SW</code> or <code>UN</code> on QWERTY with standard technique.
SFBs are generally considered undesirable. Modern <a
href="#alpha-layout">alpha layouts</a> are designed to minimize
them.</p>
<figure>
<img src="sfb.gif"
alt="SW is an SFB since S and W are pressed by the same finger." />

<kbd>S</kbd> and <kbd>W</kbd> are pressed by the same

</figure>
<h3 id="same-finger-skipgram-sfs">Same-finger skipgram (SFS)</h3>
<p>A <strong>same-finger skipgram</strong> or <strong>SFS</strong>, also
known as a <strong>disjointed same-finger bigram</strong> or
<strong>DSFB</strong>, is a key sequence in which two keys are typed by
the same finger, separated by one or more keys. How frequently SFSs
occur is often considered in <a href="#alpha-layout">layout design</a>.
Reducing SFSs is desirable to reduce how quickly fingers need to be
repositioned.</p>
<p>A <strong>skip-1-gram</strong> has one key in between, and generally
a <strong>skip-N-gram</strong> has a skip distance of N keys in between.
By extension of this terminology, a <a
href="#same-finger-bigram-sfb">same-finger bigram</a> would be a
“skip-0-gram.”</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> When typing <code>WAS</code> on QWERTY, the left
ring finger types <kbd>W</kbd> and <kbd>S</kbd>, and the pinky types
<kbd>A</kbd>. Therefore <code>WAS</code> is an SFS, specifically, a
“same finger skip-1-gram.”</p>
<h3 id="simultaneous-opposing-cardinal-directions-socd">Simultaneous
opposing cardinal directions (SOCD)</h3>
<p><strong>Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Directions</strong> or
<strong>SOCD</strong> refers to physically pressing two keys of opposing
direction at the same time, such as of the <kbd>A</kbd> and <kbd>D</kbd>
keys in WASD gaming input. <strong>SOCD cleaning</strong> performs
filtering of simultaneous inputs, applying a <strong>resolution</strong>
rule to decide which key is active. A player can leverage SOCD filtering
to make fast inputs for competitive advantage.</p>

<h3 id="splay">Splay</h3>
<p><strong>Splay</strong> is the angle between the two sides of a <a

wrists in alignment with the forearms to avoid <a

<p>Splay may also describe angles between fingers. Some <a

designs include a splay angle between the columns.</p>

<h3 id="split-keyboard">Split keyboard</h3>
<p>A <strong>true split keyboard</strong> is split in two separate
modules, connected by a flexible cable or wireless connection. The
separation and <a href="#splay">splay</a> of the two sides can be
adjusted to enable the user to achieve a neutral wrist position and
avoid <a href="#ulnar-deviation-radial-deviation">ulnar deviation</a>.
On many true split designs, the <a href="#tenting">tenting angle</a> can
be adjusted as well.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../moonlander.jpg"
alt="Example of a true split keyboard (ZSA Moonlander)." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Example of a true split keyboard (ZSA

</figure>
<p>Each side has its own <a href="#matrix-circuit">matrix circuit</a>
and <a href="#microcontroller-unit-mcu">microcontroller</a>. The two
sides communicate matrix scan events, often through a <a
href="#trrs-cable">TRRS cable</a>, though designs with a USB cable or
wireless connection are also used.</p>
<p>A <strong>unibody split keyboard</strong>, aka monoblock-, fixed-, or
pseudo-split, has two halves connected <a href="#splay">splayed</a> at
an angle as a single unit. While there is usually no separation or
flexibility to adjust the splay or tenting, it is yet an improvement
over conventional keyboards in achieving a neutral wrist position. Most
unibody designs use a single shared microcontroller and <a
href="#printed-circuit-board-pcb">printed circuit board</a>, enabling
simpler assembly.</p>

<h3 id="trrs-cable">TRRS cable</h3>
<p>The two halves of a <a href="#split-keyboard">split keyboard</a> are
commonly connected using a <strong>TRRS cable</strong> with 4-contact
tip-ring-ring-sleeve connectors or similarly a <strong>TRS
cable</strong> (tip-ring-sleeve). It provides data synchronization and
power delivery between the two sides.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Caution: <strong>do not connect or disconnect the TRRS cable while
the keyboard is powered.</strong> Doing so may create a short circuit
and damage the keyboard. Some keyboards have short protection to
tolerate this, but even so, it’s safer to unpower the keyboard first
before connecting or disconnecting the TRRS cable.</p>
<h3 id="tenting">Tenting</h3>
<p><strong>Tenting</strong> is angling each side of the keyboard in the
<a href="#pronation-supination">supinating</a> direction, an ergonomic
feature on many split keyboards. This enables the forearms to reduce <a
href="#pronation-supination">pronation</a> by adopting a more
anatomically neutral position while typing. Some keyboards have a fixed
tenting angle while some have <strong>adjustable tenting</strong>, where
the angle can be changed with folding support legs or a similar
mechanism.</p>

<h3 id="thumb-clusters">Thumb clusters</h3>
<p><strong>Thumb clusters</strong> are a set of keys to be pressed by
the thumbs, as found on most <a href="#split-keyboard">split
keyboards</a>. The number of thumb keys and their relative positioning
varies across models. Dactyl and Kinesis Advantage keyboards have thumb
clusters of 6 keys per side while the ZSA Voyager has just 2 keys per
side.</p>

<p>For users with pinky discomfort, thumb keys can be ergonomically
beneficial in offloading work conventionally done by the pinkies to the
thumbs, such as <a href="#modifiers">modifier keys</a> or the Backspace
key. However, <a href="../thumb-ergo/index.html">thumbs can get overuse
injuries</a>, so don’t overdo it. Thumbs are strong, but not
invincible.</p>
<h3 id="tilt">Tilt</h3>
<p><strong>Positive tilt</strong> inclines the back edge of the keyboard
higher than the front. <strong>Negative tilt</strong> is the opposite
direction, with the back edge lower than the front.</p>
<figure>
<img src="tilt.gif" alt="Positive tilt on a standard keyboard." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Positive tilt on a standard
keyboard.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Most keyboards come with feet that can be extended for positive tilt.
Although common, their use is ergonomically risky. <a
href="https://www.osha.gov/etools/computer-workstations/components/keyboards">OSHA
recommends against using keyboard feet</a> if they increase bending of
the wrist. Tilting the keyboard up can force the wrists into sustained
<a href="#wrist-extension-flexion">wrist extension</a>, which strains
the forearm extensor muscles.</p>
<h3 id="ulnar-deviation-radial-deviation">Ulnar deviation / radial
deviation</h3>
<p><strong>Ulnar deviation</strong> of the wrist is angling the hand in
the direction of the pinky and ulna bone. <strong>Radial
deviation</strong> is the opposite, in the direction of the thumb and
radius bone.</p>
<figure>
<img src="ulnar-radial-deviation.svg"
alt="Left: Ulnar deviation. Right: Radial deviation." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Left: Ulnar deviation. Right: Radial
deviation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Ulnar deviation of the wrist constricts the <a
href="#carpal-tunnel">carpal tunnel</a>, which reduces blood flow,
strains the tendons and muscles, and puts pressure on the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_nerve">median nerve</a>.
Prolonged typing in this posture can lead to fatigue, numbness, and
injury.</p>
<p>The keyboard should be at a comfortable distance from the body to
prevent ulnar deviation and other awkward body postures. A <a
href="#split-keyboard">split</a> or <a href="#splay">splayed</a>
keyboard can help avoid ulnar deviation. <a
href="#row-staggered-ortholinear-column-staggered">Column stagger</a>
can help as well on the left hand. For additional guidance, see <a
href="https://www.osha.gov/etools/computer-workstations/components/keyboards">OSHA’s
recommendations</a> on keyboard ergonomics.</p>
<h3 id="words-per-minute-wpm">Words per minute (WPM)</h3>
<p>Typing speed is usually reported in units of <strong>words per
minute</strong> or <strong>WPM</strong>.</p>
<p>To account for that words have varying length, a “word” in WPM
measurement is typically defined as 5 characters, counting also spaces
and punctuation. That is, WPM = CPM / 5, with CPM being the
<strong>characters per minute</strong>. In English, the average word
length is about 4.7 letters (see e.g. <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.6109">Average word length dynamics as
indicator of cultural changes in society</a>), so the conversion factor
of 5 is pretty well calibrated.</p>

type XXX wpm – Is that fast?</a></p>
<h3 id="wrist-extension-flexion">Wrist extension / flexion</h3>
<p><strong>Wrist extension</strong> engages the forearm extensor muscles
to raise the back of the hand toward the arm. <strong>Wrist
flexion</strong> is the opposite direction, using the forearm flexor
muscles.</p>
<figure>

<p>Maintain your elbows at about the same height as the keyboard when
typing. Otherwise, typing with the keyboard at an improper height forces
you to hold your hands at an unnatural angle, straining the forearm
extensors. Additionally, it’s best to avoid elevating the back of the
keyboard (<a href="#tilt">positive tilt</a>) for the same reason.</p>
