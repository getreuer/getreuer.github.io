medical advice.</b>
</p>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>An awesome feature of split keyboards like the Kinesis Advantage,
Ergodox, and Corne are their thumb keys. They’re often advocated based
on that thumbs are the strongest fingers, and thumb keys offload work
from the pinkies: “thumbs good, pinkies bad.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is not all roses. Thumbs are strong, but not
invincible. People can and do get thumb injuries from typing.
Furthermore, thumbs are built and move in ways that are biomechanically
distinct from the other fingers, so their susceptibility to injury are
not entirely comparable.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, multiple thumb keys are a fantastic tool. I wish
more keyboards had them. The point is to take it in measure and not
overdo it.</p>
<p>Dear reader, if you are interested in this topic, I assume you might
have concerns about your thumbs. Please be careful that RSI can escalate
quickly and irreversibly. If you have pain, it is important to see a
doctor promptly.</p>
<h2 id="anecdotes">Anecdotes</h2>
<p>Here are some stories of thumb pain related to typing. I am grateful
to the folks who shared these so that we may learn from their
experience.</p>
<h3 id="on-smaller-keyboards">On smaller keyboards</h3>
<p>40% keyboards tend to make heavy use of thumb keys, so the
possibility of injury there is especially concerning. About half of
these stories involve the popular Corne and other small keyboards.</p>
<p>Larger keyboard users are affected too, they are represented in the
following section.</p>
<h4 id="corne">Corne</h4>

- RSI in thumb?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does anyone find the outer thumb keys to be too far under the palm? I
started using the corne to reduce the strain on my pinkies, and now my
thumb hurts! :D I’ve set up the thumb keys to be layer switches. Number
layer is the central thumb key on hold on both hands, with number pad on
right hand, arrow keys is the outer thumb key on the right hand with
arrows on the right hand</p>

- Corne: Huge pain in the shoulder, thumbs and wrists</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I always felt a discomfort using my corne, but thought it was because
of the fact that I was tense due to not being used to it. Now ? I’m
feeling real and important pain that makes my daily life really harder.
My right thumb is hurting as hell, at first I thought it was because I
was hitting the keycaps on the side. But the pain is searing through to
the base of the thumb now, it’s almost unbearable</p>
</blockquote>

- Am I the only one that had issue with Corne thumb cluster
style?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel like the thumb cluster on Corne is a bit inward. To hit the
innermost key, I need to curl my thumb. In a long session, it leads to a
pain in my hand. […] For small average Asian hands like me, this is an
issue. Isn’t this issue more pronounced for people with a larger
hand?</p>

- Thumb Pain ergonomics</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have pain in my thumbs, mostly in the right hand. No other finger
or wrist issues. Currently I have a Corne, but I find the thumb cluster
causes soreness. I think I need a keyboard without a thumb cluster that
gets used for layers because the act of holding down a button sucks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been typing on a Cantor remix with Miryoku for about a year now.
When I switched, my wpm dropped to like 20wpm. Now that my wpm is up to
~90wpm, I am starting to notice a thumb fatigue when I type as fast as I
can. […] My main issue is, I think that the thumb cluster should be
placed one key position further outwards, so that I don’t get my thumb
folded back in under my other fingers as much. That way my fingers would
strech more.</p>

- I’m becoming a bit skeptical of multiple thumb keys, especially on a
planck</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been using a planck for a few weeks now, and while I don’t miss
reaching in order to press symbols, the tendons in my forearms hurt
after a while unlike on regular keyboards. They hurt most when pressing
thumb keys. It’s not the pressing down that seems to be the problem,
more the act of curling them under my palms.</p>

thumb</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi, I’m just wondering if anyone else has gotten RSI with a positive
“Finkelstein’s Test for De Quervain’s Tenosynovitis”? The Ergonomist at
work almost immediately diagnosed the cause as overuse of the Layer Hold
key on the thumb while fully extended. Apparently neutral or tucked is
OK, but extended is bad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the sculpt of the Skeletyl, but my thumb hurts when I use it

<p>So I have been using my Moonlander for over a month now and the pain
in my wrist/thumb/shoulder is terrible. I have tried adjusting the thumb
area, the tilt, and the angle of the boards but nothing is helping. Any
advise? I feel like the pain is from the design of the thumb cluster, I
have small hands so I feel like it’s too far away even when tilted
up…..</p>

with the ZSA Moonlander: Review</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I do know for sure is that with these hands I couldn’t find a
way to use the thumb cluster without pain. Inflammation in my thumbs and
wrists slowly accumulated during my time with the Moonlander, and really
started to worry me around week 3 - 4 when I noticed pain away from the
keyboard when I was doing things like gripping a steering wheel or
holding a cup of coffee. The locus of pain was centred at the base of
both thumbs running up to my second knuckle and back toward my wrists. I
tried all sorts of things to get relief.</p>

<p>I never had finger pain before switching to the Advantage360 a few

anyone else experienced when getting used to the thumb clusters? Any
tips?</p>

<p>I have a Kinesis Advantage 2, and I absolutely love it. I’ve been
using it for around a year, and it really saved my wrists when I
switched over, but lately I’ve gotten pretty severe tendonitis in my
left thumb. I moved some of the mod keys to the pinky but it kind of
defeats the purpose of the advantage. My hands are around average sized
but aren’t exactly huge.</p>

<p>As stated - my left thumb now has an intense shooting pain whenever I

regular keyboard).</p>

but now I’m starting to experience wrist/thumb pain and I can’t figure
it out. I’m doing all the “right” things: wrist rests, shoulder width
spacing, elbows are ~90 degrees, correct touch typing, damn good
posture, but still pain. I’ve experimented with tenting but no dice.</p>

<p>A few months ago I started noticing a slight pain in the base of my
right thumb, right where it meets the wrist. I didn’t really pay any
attention to it at first, but it kept getting worse and worse. It didn’t
register to me that it would be related to my keyboard, because “hey,
I’m using an ergo board! there is no way!” […] After examining closely
how my hands moved and what muscles I was using when typing on the
ErgoDox, I realized that it was the placement of the thumb clusters.</p>

<h2 id="common-thumb-injuries">Common thumb injuries</h2>
<p>The following is a primer on a few common kinds of thumb injuries and
the involved anatomy. In-depth references can be found in the links
under <a href="#further-reading">Further Reading</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The following is informational only. See a doctor for
professional medical advice.</strong></p>
<h3 id="texters-thumb-aka-de-quervains-tenosynovitis">Texter’s thumb,
aka De Quervain’s tenosynovitis</h3>
<p>Outside the niche world of custom ergo keyboards, a common kind of
thumb injury is “texter’s thumb,” aka De Quervain’s tenosynovitis, from
excessive texting on smart phones. A keyboard with thumb keys appears to
pose a similar possibility of injury, since thumb use is comparable.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Quervain_syndrome">De
Quervain’s tenosynovitis</a> is a condition of inflammation on the thumb
side of the wrist, in the sheath around the tendons that go to the thumb
(the tendons for the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensor_pollicis_brevis_muscle">extensor
pollicis brevis</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductor_pollicis_longus_muscle">abductor
pollicis longus</a> muscles).</p>
<figure>
<img src="thumb-tendons.svg"
alt="Tendon sheath for the extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Tendon sheath for the extensor pollicis
brevis and abductor pollicis longus.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>De Quervain’s causes pain and swelling at the base of the thumb and
thumb side of the wrist. It can make grasping and pinching movements
painful and weak. It can become debilitating if untreated and may
require surgery.</p>
<h3 id="thumb-pain-in-carpal-tunnel-syndrome">Thumb pain in carpal
tunnel syndrome</h3>
<p>Though not specific to the thumb, carpal tunnel syndrome is one of
the most common kinds of injuries involving thumb pain. The carpal
tunnel is a narrow passageway on the palm side of the wrist formed by
the arch-shaped <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_bones">carpal bones</a> and
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexor_retinaculum_of_the_hand">flexor
retinaculum</a> connective tissue. The flexor tendons to the fingers and
the median nerve pass through the carpal tunnel.</p>
<figure>
<img src="carpal-tunnel.svg"
alt="Median nerve passing through the carpal tunnel." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Median nerve passing through the carpal
tunnel.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome">Carpal
tunnel syndrome (CTS)</a>, also more specifically referred to as
Idiopathic Median Neuropathy at the Carpal Tunnel (IMNCT), is a
condition where the median nerve is pinched in the carpal tunnel,
perhaps because inflammation caused surrounding tissues to swell and
decrease the space in the tunnel.</p>
<p>Damage to the median nerve can cause numbness, tingling, and burning
sensations in the thumb and other fingers. The pain is usually worse at
night. There may also be weakness and clumsiness. Carpal tunnel syndrome
can lead to irreversible nerve damage and loss of hand function if
untreated.</p>
<h3 id="ulnar-collateral-ligament-ucl-injury">Ulnar collateral ligament
(UCL) injury</h3>
<p>Another common thumb injury is tearing the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_collateral_ligament_injury_of_the_thumb">ulnar
collateral ligament or UCL</a>, a tissue in the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpophalangeal_joint">metacarpophalangeal
(MCP) joint</a> where the thumb meets the palm.</p>
<figure>

alt="Close up of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Close up of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP)
joint.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The chronic version of UCL injury is called <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_collateral_ligament_injury_of_the_thumb">“gamekeeper’s
thumb.”</a> Historically, it was common for game keepers to kill a
rabbit by breaking its neck between the thumbs, forefingers, and the
ground. A force bending the thumb in the outward (valgus) direction
engages the UCL. The stress from performing this practice regularly
causes attrition in the UCL and can lead to a chronic injury.</p>
<p>Certainly, breaking a rabbit’s neck takes more force than holding a
key. Yet it’s worth mentioning that the UCL is another weak point in
thumb anatomy.</p>
<h2 id="countermeasures">Countermeasures</h2>
<p>Many anecdotes above were at least partially to blame on misfitting
between keyboard and the user’s hand size. When shopping for keyboards,
you can use <a
href="https://jhelvy.shinyapps.io/splitkbcompare/">Splitkbcompare</a> to
make 1:1 prints of many keyboards and test how they fit your hands.
(Printing tips: double check the paper type and page orientation, and
measure the included centimeter marks to verify that the print scaled
correctly.)</p>
<figure>
<img src="test-fit.jpg"
alt="Trying my hand on a print of the Lily58." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Trying my hand on a print of the
Lily58.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A few anecdotes warn about certain problematic motions, like those
where the thumb has to stretch to reach the key. In my keymap, I think
about how often I press each key and avoid putting more than one
“high-use” function on each thumb to reduce side-to-side and reaching
motions. Instead of holding the thumb keys, I go for layer switches that
toggle on tap or by using sticky (one-shot) keys.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It pays to keep a critical eye on ergonomics. Keep those thumbs
healthy! 👍 👍</p>
