<p>Thinking of buying a custom keyboard? Or got one and looking to
leverage its features? Here’s a tour.</p>

<h2 id="ergonomic-hardware">Ergonomic hardware</h2>
<p>For typing comfort, I highly recommend a keyboard that is
<strong>split, columnar, and with QMK or other programmable
firmware</strong>. An example is the ZSA Moonlander keyboard:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../moonlander.jpg" alt="ZSA Moonlander" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">ZSA Moonlander</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Some other popular options are the Lily58, Sofle, and Corne split
keyboards. There’s an extensive catalog of split keyboards at <a
href="https://github.com/diimdeep/awesome-split-keyboards">Awesome Split
Keyboards</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-makes-these-keyboards-so-good">What makes these keyboards
so good</h3>
<p><strong>A split keyboard</strong> has separate modules for each hand
connected by a flexible cable. This enables you to type with your hands
comfortably at shoulder width apart and with wrists straight to avoid
ulnar deviation.</p>
<p><img src="split.svg" /></p>
<p>A <strong>columnar</strong> keyboard has aligned columns of keys.
This is in contrast to the row-staggered keys of conventional keyboards,
a vestige of mechanical typewriters to make space for levers that
connect each key to the type hammers that strike the paper. Columnar
arrangement follows the natural direction of the fingers and helps
reduce ulnar deviation in the left wrist.</p>
<p><img src="stagger.svg" /></p>
<p>A <strong>programmable</strong> keyboard is one where the function of
each key may be reassigned, perform macros, and so on to adapt to your
workflow. More on this in a moment.</p>
<h3 id="tips-to-get-a-good-keyboard">Tips to get a good keyboard</h3>
<p>Ergonomic keyboards differ in placement of the thumb buttons as well
as in the stagger and splay or the columns. You can use <a
href="https://jhelvy.shinyapps.io/splitkbcompare/">Splitkbcompare</a> to
make 1:1 prints for many popular keyboards to test how they fit your
hands.</p>
<p>Keyboards often use cheap AVR microcontrollers, like the Pro Micro
and Elite-C boards with the ATmega32U4 microcontroller. While they are
enough to get running, AVR microcontrollers have a stingy amount of
flash space, and you’ll need to be sparing in which firmware features to
enable in order to fit in that space (see <a
href="https://docs.qmk.fm/#/squeezing_avr">Squeezing the most out of
AVR</a>). If you have an option to use a better microcontroller, I’d
recommend it.</p>
<h3 id="where-to-buy-split-keyboards">Where to buy split keyboards</h3>
<p>The r/ErgoMechKeyboards wiki has a <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/wiki/resources/#wiki_vendors">list
of vendors</a> that sell split and ergonomic keyboards, organized by
region. You can also try <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/">r/mechmarket</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A few notes to give fair warning…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>These keyboards are not exactly cheap, in the ballpark of $250
USD. This is an investment in your comfort.</p></li>
<li><p>Custom keyboards are often sold as kits that you assemble
yourself. If you don’t want to do that, look for <em>prebuilt</em>
keyboards or vendors with a <em>build service</em> to assemble a kit for
you.</p></li>
<li><p>Typing on a split columnar keyboard takes some time to adjust, <a
href="../faqs/index.html#how-long-to-get-used-to-a-split-columnar-keyboard">around
a couple weeks</a> for many people.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="firmware-features">Firmware features</h2>
<p>Here are some highlight features of what a keyboard with <a
href="https://docs.qmk.fm/#/">QMK firmware</a> can do, potentially
boosting your comfort and productivity.</p>
<p>QMK is not strictly necessary. Other programmable keyboards have
their own firmware features, and at least basic functionality is
comparable. Or even with a regular keyboard, you can get some of these
features in software with <a
href="https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad">KMonad</a>.</p>
<p><em>(Ergodox EZ and Moonlander users)</em> If you use Oryx, then
underneath it is QMK firmware, and most of these features are available
in Oryx.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-layers">Multiple layers</h3>
<p>Generalizing how e.g. holding Shift changes the number row to type
symbols, you can <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/#/keymap">define multiple
layers</a> and use “layer switch keys” to access them. For instance, <a
href="../symbol-layer/index.html">a symbol layer</a> is useful for
programming. Never run out of keys.</p>

layout).</figcaption>

<img src="layout_symbol.png" alt="My symbol layer." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">My symbol layer.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="home-row-mods">Home row mods</h3>
<p>The idea of home row mods is to put the modifier keys—Ctrl, Shift,
Alt, Gui (Win key)—directly on the home row as <a
href="https://docs.qmk.fm/#/mod_tap">mod-tap keys</a>. This has the
ergonomic advantage of reducing finger travel and awkward hand
positions. <a href="https://github.com/getreuer/qmk-keymap">In my
keymap</a>, I additionally put layer-tap keys on the home row to access
the symbol layer.</p>
<figure>
<img src="hrm.png" alt="Home row mods in my keymap." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Home row mods in my keymap.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The <code>E</code> key for example types “e” when tapped and behaves
as Shift when held.</p>
<p>I was skeptical at first, but home row mods feel great now that I got
used to them. As you might expect, there is a learning curve. See <a
href="https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods">A guide to home row
mods</a> for a detailed explanation and <a
href="../faqs/index.html#home-row-mods-are-hard-to-use">Home row mods
are hard to use</a> for further tips.</p>
<h3 id="do-more-with-each-key">Do more with each key</h3>
<p>There are several additional QMK features to get more out of each
key:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_combo">Combos</a> – Hit
multiple keys at once to produce a different effect.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/#/mod_tap">Mod-Tap</a> – Behave as a
modifier when held, a different key when tapped.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_layers">Layer-Tap</a> –
Layer switch when held, a different key when tapped.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_tap_dance">Tap Dance</a> –
Do something different when tapped vs. held vs. double-tapped…</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_key_overrides">Key
Overrides</a> – Override modifier-key combinations to do something
else.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are many options to facilitate your workflow!</p>
<h3 id="macro-buttons">Macro buttons</h3>
<p>It’s possible to define a macro button that types multiple characters
when pressed. My favorite is a key that types <code>../</code>, useful
in the shell for up directory. See <a href="../macros/index.html">Macro
buttons</a> for a collection of QMK macros and <a
href="../triggers/index.html">QMK triggers</a> for further tricks.</p>
<p>QMK allows the user to write arbitrary C code to handle events. This
is great flexibility. I’ve been having fun with this to write my own
features as userspace libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="../achordion/index.html">Achordion</a> – customize the
tap-hold decision</p></li>
<li><p><a href="../autocorrection/index.html">Autocorrection</a> – run
rudimentary autocorrection on your keyboard</p></li>

alternative to Caps Lock</p></li>
<li><p><a href="../custom-shift-keys/index.html">Custom shift keys</a> –
they’re surprisingly tricky to get right; here is my approach</p></li>
<li><p><a href="../layer-lock/index.html">Layer Lock key</a> – macro to
stay in the current layer</p></li>
<li><p><a href="../mouse-turbo-click/index.html">Mouse Turbo Click</a> –
macro that clicks the mouse rapidly</p></li>
<li><p><a href="../repeat-key/index.html">Repeat Key</a> – an extensible
“repeat last key” implementation</p></li>
<li><p><a href="../sentence-case/index.html">Sentence Case</a> –
