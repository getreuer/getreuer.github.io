<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This post is about switching from QWERTY to an alternative keyboard
layout. Why and how do people switch? Which alt layout is best—Dvorak,
Colemak, …?</p>
<h2 id="why-do-people-want-to-use-alt-layouts">Why do people want to use
alt layouts?</h2>
<p><strong>The main motivation for alt layouts is better typing
comfort.</strong> Alternatives to QWERTY dramatically reduce awkward
typing motions such as same-finger bigrams (SFBs), reduce how much your
fingers need to move (finger travel) to accomplish the same typing, and
balance the typing workload over the fingers more evenly.</p>
<p>QWERTY was designed by Christopher Sholes in the early 1870s for the
Sholes and Glidden mechanical typewriter. It’s often said QWERTY was
designed to avoid the typebars from jamming, though <a
href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/fact-of-fiction-the-legend-of-the-qwerty-keyboard-49863249/">it’s
debatable whether that’s historically accurate</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>What is obvious though is that QWERTY has a lot of SFBs, like
<code>ed</code>, <code>un</code>, <code>rt</code>, <code>ol</code>, much
more than any popular alt layout. Think about typing “<code>loft</code>”
or “<code>unheard</code>.” Those same-finger movements are slow and
awkward to type.</p>
<p>To be fair, QWERTY was basically the first successful layout, a
pioneering solution to a tough problem. It shouldn’t be surprising that
its metrics are far from optimal. At the time it was created, the
activity of typing itself was also new.</p>
<h2 id="should-i-use-an-alt-layout">Should I use an alt layout?</h2>
<p>It’s your choice. You don’t <em>have</em> to learn an alt layout.</p>
<p>Switching to an alt layout takes a lot of effort (<a
href="#how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-an-alt-layout">at least a couple
months of daily practice</a>), and the benefits are not huge. I don’t
mean to be discouraging, just raising some counterpoints:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If your hope is that changing layout will increase your typing
speed, let me point out that speed is a matter of typing practice, not
layout. There are plenty of extremely fast speed typists who use
QWERTY.</p></li>
<li><p>If your motivation is typing comfort, consider first correcting
your posture, switching to a split columnar keyboard, or switching to a
modal editor like Vim—all of these things are more impactful and easier
to do than learning a new layout.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So why do it? For me, switching to an alt layout is a long-term
investment in my health and comfort. I will type a lot in my life (I
work as a software engineer), so spending several months learning a new
layout is a fair price.</p>

layout should I learn?</h2>
<p><strong>There is no consensus on what is the “best” layout. No layout
is perfect.</strong> Layout design is a balancing act of many competing
objectives.</p>
<p><strong>I highly recommend reading the <a
href="https://bit.ly/keyboard-layouts-doc">Keyboard layouts
doc</a>.</strong> It lists numerous alternative layouts along with
metrics for easy comparison along with analysis and suggestions on how
to choose a layout. Summary metrics from the doc for a few notable
layouts (lower is better for SFBs, LSBs, and redirects; higher is better
for rolls):</p>

<p><a href="https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/">Colemak mod-DH</a> is
quite popular in the custom keyboard community. A fair number of folks
use Dvorak, myself included (<a href="#whats-great-about-dvorak">What’s
great about Dvorak?</a>). <a
href="https://semilin.github.io/semimak/">Semimak JQ</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/Apsu/APT#aptv3-layout">APTv3</a> seem to be
recent favorites. There are many choices out there besides these.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-an-alt-layout">How long does it
take to learn an alt layout?</h2>
<p><strong>Realistically, expect it to take at least a couple months of
daily typing practice.</strong> Switching to a new layout is a large
undertaking. It took me a few months to get to 50 wpm on Dvorak and
about a year to get back to my former QWERTY speed of 80 wpm. Other
people have reported similar order-of-months experience to learn a new
layout. It’s worth it for the comfort, but be patient and approach it as
a long project.</p>
<p>The first couple weeks are the hardest since your typing will be
frustratingly slow. Some people believe in switching to using the new
layout alone “cold turkey” as the best way to learn. You can do that,
but I don’t think it’s necessary. In the first couple weeks, I’ve found
decent progress doing 30 minutes of practice a day on the new layout,
then switching back to my familiar layout for the rest of the day. Then
once getting to a usable 30 wpm or so, switching the new layout full
time is more bearable.</p>
<p>Some advice, speaking from experience about my mistakes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Check that you can type your computer password in the new
layout</strong>… otherwise you might get locked out.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use proper touch typing form when practicing.</strong>
Keyboard layouts are designed assuming which finger presses which keys.
This determines which key pairs create SFBs. If your typing form is
nonstandard, this changes (likely dramatically for the worse) the
layout’s frequency of SFBs. Learning a new layout is an opportunity to
brush up your form. See also: <a
href="../faqs/index.html#should-i-learn-how-to-touch-type">Should I
learn how to touch type?</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be careful about rearranging keys in a layout</strong>
for the same reason. Shifting a row or swapping some keys arbitrarily is
likely to ruin the layout. If you’re really tempted to do this, use a
tool like the <a
href="https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/analyze.html">colemak mods
analyzer</a> or <a
href="https://o-x-e-y.github.io/layouts/playground/index.html">O-X-E-Y’s
layout playground</a> to check how metrics are affected.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For typing practice, <a href="https://monkeytype.com/">MonkeyType</a>
is excellent. See the “Typing practice” section of the <a
href="https://bit.ly/keyboard-layouts-doc">Keyboard layouts doc</a> for
tips on how to use it effectively for learning a new layout. Some other
good typing practice sites are <a
href="https://www.keybr.com/">keybr.com</a> and <a
href="https://ranelpadon.github.io/ngram-type/">Ngram Type</a>. There
are many other great typing websites out there. To make practice more
fun, I suggest trying several websites and revolving through the ones
you like.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-keycap-labels">What about keycap labels?</h2>
<p>You would think that to avoid confusion, changing to an alternative
layout means you also need to rearrange or relabel your keycaps to agree
with the layout. Fortunately, this turns out to be a non-issue in
practice. Surely, you plan to touch type on the new layout? (You
should!) With proper touch typing, you will never look at the keys, and
keycap labels don’t matter.</p>
<p>While touch typing is the goal, there is still the problem of knowing
where the keys are when getting started. Here is a strategy that works
for me. Write down the new layout on paper. Write it again and again
until you can reproduce it correctly from memory. For later reference,
write the layout on a slip of paper and put it below your monitor. After
a couple weeks of typing practice, you won’t need the paper slip
anymore.</p>
<h2 id="whats-great-about-dvorak">What’s great about Dvorak?</h2>
<p>The Dvorak layout puts all the vowels on the left hand, encouraging
regular hand alternation around every syllable. It arranges a fair
number of common bigrams as 2-key inward rolls (non-exhaustive list:
<code>th</code>, <code>nd</code>, <code>sh</code>, <code>ch</code>,
<code>ng</code>, <code>wh</code>, <code>qu</code>). This alternation and
short roll design makes typing in Dvorak fast and comfortable.</p>
<figure>
<img src="dvorak-annotated.svg"
alt="The Dvorak layout, with a few bigram rolls annotated." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The Dvorak layout, with a few bigram
rolls annotated.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Besides this, what’s distinctly good about Dvorak is how it works
with Vim default keybindings, with <kbd>J</kbd> and <kbd>K</kbd>
comfortably under left middle and index fingers. Most other alt layouts
push these keys out to awkward corners of the keyboard.</p>
<p>You might say this shouldn’t matter, since Vim allows remapping keys
to any position regardless of layout. This is plausible, but the
downside is that if I map <code>J</code> to, say, the <kbd>N</kbd> key,
then I also need to map <code>N</code> somewhere else or lose that
function. Furthermore, besides Vim itself, there are many other programs
and websites with Vim-inspired keybindings, and they don’t necessarily
support remapping.</p>
<p>The reason <kbd>J</kbd> and <kbd>K</kbd> are bad in most alt layouts
is because layouts are most often optimized on metrics over a corpus of
English text. But what is <em>written</em> is not quite the same as what
keys were <em>typed</em>. Therefore, most layouts overlook hotkeys and
Vim normal mode commands. To make the point, here is a keylog snippet of
me using Vim:</p>
<pre><code>jwkkwwwrowwwcwopen line  wjjkkbbbbbri wwwvwwhcinsert  wjjkkbbbbrawwwceappend
wjjkjjBesides Vim itself, there are numerous othermany othother progrmas

like this for every program kbbbbwcwfor those that do wvwwhxhxoand maintain
Jwwwb for them. kwwwwwwwihave to JwbwvwwwhbhxwwbkwwvwcE kkko w jj p</code></pre>
<p>A sizable portion of my keystrokes are commands rather than written
text, with navigation keys <code>j</code>, <code>k</code>,
<code>w</code>, <code>b</code> appearing especially often. Of course,
this increases the frequencies for these letters compared to normal
English. In English, they rank among the least frequent letters:
<code>W</code> is 18th, <code>B</code> is 20th, <code>K</code> is 22nd,
and <code>J</code> is 24th.</p>
<p>Some other good features about Dvorak:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keys <kbd>,</kbd> and <kbd>.</kbd> are in the top row, next to
the number row, making decimal numbers and comma-delimited data less of
a reach. This seems so natural!</p></li>
<li><p>The <kbd>-</kbd> key, and <code>_</code> when shifted, is just
off the home row on the right. This is great for programming, where
<code>_</code> is one of the most frequent symbols.</p></li>
<li><p>For programming, the <code>td</code> in “<code>std</code>” (in
C++, Rust, …) is an SFB on Colemak and most other popular alternative
layouts, but <em>not</em> in Dvorak.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m aware Dvorak has flaws. It’s pinky placement of <kbd>L</kbd> is a
fair complaint. I’ve made several stints of trying other layouts: <a
href="https://xsznix.wordpress.com/2016/05/16/introducing-the-rsthd-layout/">RSTHD</a>,
<a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/BEAKL#BEAKL_15">BEAKL 15</a>, <a
href="https://notgate.github.io/layout/">ISRT</a>, and took a couple
shots at designing my own layout using <a
href="https://github.com/xsznix/keygen">xsznix’s keygen</a>. But for
various reasons, after a few weeks, kept coming back to Dvorak. Long
story short, no layout is perfect. I tolerate Dvorak’s shortcomings and
appreciate how much it gets right.</p>
